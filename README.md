# plain-java-json
Simple JSON parser and serializer using only Java types (e.g. ArrayList and HashMap).
More educational, it aims to be small in code size.

Known limitiation:
*Escaping in strings not implemented (what you get from the parser is with escapes, with need to give to the serializer is escaped strings)
*Not speed nor memory optimized
